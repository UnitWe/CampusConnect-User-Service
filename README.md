To be able to run our application locally we must create a new .env file in the main project directory. A template file is already provided where it shows which environment variables are used, just create an <strong>.env</strong> file in the same location as the <strong>.env.example</strong>, copy the content provided in it and paste it in the file you created modifying it to the settings of your local machine.
